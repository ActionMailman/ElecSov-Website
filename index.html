      <h1>Taking control of our electricity!</h1>
      <h2>Through software and code, we can affect the material ramifications of digital infrastructure.</h2>
      <p>Waste in the modern era isn't just limited to plastic and coal. Power contributes its own share of ecological harm, and conservation is an important goal within our own personal capability as consumers.
        <br>This website is home to the Waste Tracker, which records information regarding your computer's energy usage while idle, along with a writeup on electric sovereignty, and the ecological ramifications of the digital era.
        <br><br>
        The next steps for the Waste Tracker include proper application creation, an accessible UI, Windows and Mac OS X implementation, and tracking of other devices.
